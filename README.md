# gps-filter

Tool set for filtering and cleaning-up gps data. Remodels the data set as vectors in order to accomplish this.

## Installation

Download node at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and install it, if you haven't already.

```sh
npm install gps-filter --save
```
## Use
```sh
# Points is expected to be an array of GPS points with a latitude, longitude, and timestamp;
# Valid formats: Latitude: [lat, latitude, y]
#               Longitude[lng,longitude,x] 
#               Timestamp[time, timestamp, startime]
                
#Coordinate data in decimal, timestamp can be in any format momentjs can handle
#ALL SPEEDS ARE IN M/S
var gps-filter = require('gps-filter')

.positionFilter(points,min,max)
  #Removes points where the change in position is outside the bounds
  returns arrayOfFilteredPoints
  
.velocityFilter(points,min,max)
  #Removes points where the velocity is outside the bounds
  returns arrayOfFilteredPoints

.accelerationFilter(points,min,max)
  #Removes points where the acceleration is outside the bounds
  returns arrayOfFilteredPoints

.removeSpikes(points,sharpness,iterations)
  #Remove points where the angle between the vector that starts there and ends there is greater than the sharpness
  #E.g _/\_ ->  _ _ 
  #Sharpness: 0-Removes all points, 180-Removes None
  
  #Iterations: defines the number of passes
  returns arrayOfFilteredPoints

.smoothLine(points, threshold)
  #Removes points by assuming that if the sum of two vectors is ~parallel to the one
  #before it they should be combined
  #E.G. __/\ -> ___ 
  #~parallel is defined by threshold
  #Threshold: 0-Vectors must be perfectly parallel 180-Every vector considered parallel (will delete everything!)
  returns arrayOfFilteredPoints

```

## Tests

```sh
npm install
npm test
```
